To convert Darknet weights to Keras format, you can use one of several available tools. 
Here, I'll provide instructions for using the yad2k library, which is a popular tool for converting Darknet weights to Keras format.

Clone the yad2k repository from GitHub:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/allanzelener/YAD2K.git
Download the Darknet weights file for the YOLOv2 608x608 model:

ruby
Copy code
wget https://pjreddie.com/media/files/yolo.weights
Convert the Darknet weights to Keras format using the yad2k script:

bash
Copy code
cd YAD2K
python yad2k.py yolo.cfg yolo.weights model_data/yolo.h5

In this command, replace yolo.cfg with the path to the Darknet configuration file for the 
YOLOv2 608x608 model, and replace yolo.weights with the path to the Darknet weights file you downloaded in 
step 2. The third argument (model_data/yolo.h5) is the path where you want to save the Keras weights file.

Note that the yad2k script requires that you have Keras and TensorFlow installed, as well as other dependencies.

Once the conversion is complete, you can load the Keras weights into your model using the load_weights() method, 
as shown in a previous answer. Here's an example:

python
Copy code
from keras.models import load_model

# Load the YOLOv2 608x608 model
model = yolo_v2_608()

# Load the converted weights
weights_path = 'model_data/yolo.h5'
model.load_weights(weights_path)

# Make predictions using the loaded model
predictions = model.predict(input_data)
In the above code, replace input_data with your actual input data in the shape (batch_size, 608, 608, 3).
